- python modular programming
- how to work with json file
- object oriented prgramming

Modular programming:

- the way we contruct is we create asa function
- function is a block of reusable code
- we break AI worflows into small functions, it is easier
to troubleshoot if anything breaks
- chaining- chain function with another function

don't we need __init__.py for python to recognize as a pacakge for import, isn't it mandatory ? -- only if the packages is in different folder

python dictonary and json:

JSON - javaa script object notation 

for data exchange between 2 system we use json notation

json is similar to python dict but it is text based elements we create

Object Oriented Programming:

classes and objects

classes are blueprint of objects
