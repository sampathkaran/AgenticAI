what is AI?
- becuase of data and computation resources AI has emerdge now
- compute and data is the 2essential elements that make up AI

Foundations of AI:

- AI can do anaylsis and  some ability to toake action
- based on historical data it will learn the pattern and solve problem
- Natural Language Understanding -  a languague used by humans- the system that has ability to proces natural language is NLP
- AI can niterpret, understand and respond to human language, like chatgpt
- modalities - the type dataa like text, image, video, strcutred data of AI

ML:

- ML is a subset of AI
- it can do only analysis and cannot take action
- we use various ML models to find patterns

Deep Learning:
- subset of ML
- we use make use of specialized architecture called neural network

all the above helping in predictive analysis

for the above the data should be strucutured format

the aobve models were working with rules

with arch like transformers we get to generative AI where it can create new contet
based on the past like GPT

To work with Chatbot we need Generative AI

gen Ai is a type of AI

These are the arch used before in Generative AI
GeneratiVe Adversarial Networks (GAN)
Variational Autoenoders(VAES)
- data compression technique
- challenge - time taken was more
Synthetic Data Generation


Large Language Model :
- understand contxt by natural language
- can produce relevant and coherent(inline) with user input
- most of LLMs work with text data
- uses language modellig tehnique
- language modelling task is to find relationship between works in input 
- it creates vector maps to group the reatlionship between words

corpus ==> collection of text data


is no. of token = no.of words


Agentic AI

- work autonomoisly without human interaction 
- FM are the LLMs that are used to perform tasks such as text classification, langugate translation etc
- LLM can understand interpret NLU
- LLMs are context aware and it can perform really well


Agent - is a AI enbled sysyem which has ability to take decision based on certain input

Types of Agent:
- Business- Task Agent - automate predefine business workflow eg RPA, Microsoft Power Automate, Zapier APP integration. Here there is no thinking it has just rules
- Conversational Agent - Chatbots, customer service agents, engage user with NLB interface, has thinkinh
- Research Agents - good in gathering info, summarizing data eg scan docs, scan Knowledgebases and provide structured output eg preplexity AI 
- Alanlytics Agents - powerBi copilot/glean, focus on interpret structured datasets, insights dashboard and reports
- Developer Agents - tools like cusor, winsurf, gitub copilot, assit developers generation of code ?
- Domain Specific Agents - agents specialief for medical, legal 
- Browser using agents
- voice agents
- video agents

agents that use modality of text/code is commonly used 


traditional AU vs Agentic Ai


does no.of agents combine to form an agentic AI system ?
In AI agent system when the LLM does not have the data and get the data from duck duck go does it get trained in realtime as well while sending response to user ie when someone ask the same question again it coms from LLM?

Principles of Agentic AI

- Modulairty
- Scalablility
- Interoperability
- Reinorcement learning 

Frameworks for orchestration:

- Lang graph
   - pros 
      - supports modular orchestration
      - supports graph like structure
   - Tradeoff - required custom logic for advanced planning & mmeory
   - suited f-r: building single/multi agent systems
- Autogen
 - pros: powerful multiagent orchestration, multiple role assigment, 
 - tradeoff: complex for simple usecases
 - suited for : research base systems

 - CrewAI
  - pros: easy to learn ad use
  - TradeoffL limited customization
  - suited for: develop for started quick

- OpenAI agents SDL
- pros _ integration with openAi tool
- tradeoff


Langchain:

- each and evey model provider will provide an API
- common framework used for all models, so if we change the model later it is easier
- lc comes with prebuilt common pattern such for tool calling, chain of though, RAG
- building block approach ie for llm a block, tool a block etc

Output format:

- When using template the system message is somewhat fixed
- we template the human messages in most of the time
- we difne a schema ie to decide waht outout filds should we see by specifying keys


MCP:

MCP is a communication fraemwork that definers how ythe agents connect and exchange data with external systems
